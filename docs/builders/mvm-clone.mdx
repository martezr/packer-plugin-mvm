# Morpheus MVM Clone Builder

Type: `mvm-clone`

Artifact BuilderId: `morpheus.mvm-clone`

This builder creates a template (virtual image), modifies the virtual machine image, and saves the result
as a new template (virtual image) using the Morpheus API.

## Examples

Examples are available in the [examples](https://github.com/martezr/packer-plugin-mvm/tree/main/examples/)
directory of the GitHub repository.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for this builder. In addition to the items listed
here, you will want to review the general configuration references for [Hardware](#hardware-configuration),
[Output](#output-configuration), [Boot](#boot-configuration), [Run](#run-configuration), [Shutdown](#shutdown-configuration),
[Communicator](#communicator-configuration), and [Export](#export-configuration) configuration
references, which are necessary for a build to succeed and can be found further down the page.

**Optional:**

@include 'builder/mvm/clone/Config-not-required.mdx'

### Storage Configuration

When cloning a virtual machine, the storage configuration can be used to add additional storage and
disk controllers. The resulting virtual machine will contain the origin virtual machine storage and
disk controller plus the new configured ones.


**Required:**


**Optional:**

@include 'builder/mvm/clone/StorageVolume-not-required.mdx'

#### Network Interface Settings

**Optional:**

@include 'builder/mvm/clone/NetworkInterface-required.mdx'

### Boot Configuration

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/bootcommand/BootConfig.mdx'

**Optional:**

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/bootcommand/BootConfig-not-required.mdx'

### HTTP Directory Configuration

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/multistep/commonsteps/HTTPConfig.mdx'

**Optional:**

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/multistep/commonsteps/HTTPConfig-not-required.mdx'

- `http_interface` (string) - The network interface (for example, `en0`, `ens192`, etc.) that the
  HTTP server will use to serve the `http_directory`. The plugin will identify the IP address
  associated with this network interface and bind to it.


~> **Notes:**
  - The options `http_bind_address` and `http_interface` are mutually exclusive.
  - Both `http_bind_address` and `http_interface` have higher priority than `http_ip`.
  - The `http_bind_address` is matched against the IP addresses of the host's network interfaces. If
    no match is found, the plugin will terminate.
  - Similarly, `http_interface` is compared with the host's network interfaces. If there's no
    corresponding network interface, the plugin will also terminate.
  - If neither `http_bind_address`, `http_interface`, and `http_ip` are provided, the plugin will
    automatically find and use the IP address of the first non-loopback interface for `http_ip`.

### Connection Configuration

**Optional:**


### Wait Configuration

**Optional:**


### Communicator Configuration

#### Common

**Optional:**

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/Config-not-required.mdx'

#### SSH

**Optional:**

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSH-not-required.mdx'

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSH-Key-Pair-Name-not-required.mdx'

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSH-Private-Key-File-not-required.mdx'

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSH-Agent-Auth-not-required.mdx'

#### Windows Remote Management (WinRM)

**Optional:**

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/WinRM-not-required.mdx'
