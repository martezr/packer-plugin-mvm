### Boot Configuration

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

The boot configuration is very important: `boot_command` specifies the keys
to type when the virtual machine is first booted in order to start the OS
installer. This command is typed after boot_wait, which gives the virtual
machine some time to actually load.

The boot_command is an array of strings. The strings are all typed in
sequence. It is an array only to improve readability within the template.

There are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot
command, they will be replaced by the proper key:

-   `<bs>` - Backspace

-   `<del>` - Delete

-   `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual "enter" or "return" keypress.

-   `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.

-   `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.

-   `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.

-   `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.

-   `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.

-   `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.

-   `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.

  - `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down
    keys.

-   `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.

-   `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.

-   `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.

-   `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.

-   `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.

  - `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before
    sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally
    wait for the UI to update before typing more.

  - `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys.
    The format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with
    optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.
    Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For
    example `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`.

  - `<XXXOn> <XXXOff>` - Any printable keyboard character, and of these
    "special" expressions, with the exception of the `<wait>` types, can
    also be toggled on or off. For example, to simulate ctrl+c, use
    `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them, otherwise they
    will be held down until the machine reboots. To hold the `c` key down,
    you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.

  - `{{ .HTTPIP }} {{ .HTTPPort }}` - The IP and port, respectively of an
    HTTP server that is started serving the directory specified by the
    `http_directory` configuration parameter. If `http_directory` isn't
    specified, these will be blank!

-   `{{ .Name }}` - The name of the VM.

Example boot command. This is actually a working boot command used to start an
CentOS 6.4 installer:

In JSON:

```json
"boot_command": [

	   "<tab><wait>",
	   " ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>"
	]

```

In HCL2:

```hcl
boot_command = [

	   "<tab><wait>",
	   " ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>"
	]

```

For more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our
[community templates page](https://packer.io/community-tools#templates).

**Optional:**

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `boot_keygroup_interval` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Time to wait after sending a group of key pressses. The value of this
  should be a duration. Examples are `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause
  Packer to wait five seconds and one minute 30 seconds, respectively. If
  this isn't specified, a sensible default value is picked depending on
  the builder type.

- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual machine before typing
  the `boot_command`. The value of this should be a duration. Examples are
  `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause Packer to wait five seconds and one
  minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't specified, the default is
  `10s` or 10 seconds. To set boot_wait to 0s, use a negative number, such
  as "-1s"

- `boot_command` ([]string) - This is an array of commands to type when the virtual machine is first
  booted. The goal of these commands should be to type just enough to
  initialize the operating system installer. Special keys can be typed as
  well, and are covered in the section below on the boot command. If this
  is not specified, it is assumed the installer will start itself.

### HTTP Directory Configuration

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

Packer will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a
random free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory
referenced will be available in your builder.

Example usage from a builder:

```
wget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg
```

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->


**Optional:**

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this
  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the
  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.
  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be
  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as
  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.

- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and
  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the
  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.
  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By
  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The
  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in
  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.
  Example:
  ```hcl
    http_content = {
      "/a/b"     = file("http/b")
      "/foo/bar" = templatefile("${path.root}/preseed.cfg", { packages = ["nginx"] })
    }
  ```

- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server
  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in
  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to
  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one
  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same. By default the values
  are `8000` and `9000`, respectively.

- `http_port_max` (int) - HTTP Port Max

- `http_bind_address` (string) - This is the bind address for the HTTP server. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 so that
  it will work with any network interface.

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->


- `http_interface` (string) - The network interface (for example, `en0`, `ens192`, etc.) that the
  HTTP server will use to serve the `http_directory`. The plugin will identify the IP address
  associated with this network interface and bind to it.


~> **Notes:**
  - The options `http_bind_address` and `http_interface` are mutually exclusive.
  - Both `http_bind_address` and `http_interface` have higher priority than `http_ip`.
  - The `http_bind_address` is matched against the IP addresses of the host's network interfaces. If
    no match is found, the plugin will terminate.
  - Similarly, `http_interface` is compared with the host's network interfaces. If there's no
    corresponding network interface, the plugin will also terminate.
  - If neither `http_bind_address`, `http_interface`, and `http_ip` are provided, the plugin will
    automatically find and use the IP address of the first non-loopback interface for `http_ip`.

### Connection Configuration

**Optional:**


### Wait Configuration

**Optional:**


### Communicator Configuration

#### Common

**Optional:**

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `communicator` (string) - Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:
  
  -   `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most
      provisioners also can't be used.
  
  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This
      is usually the default.
  
  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.
  
  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they
  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a "docker" communicator
  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy
  files.

- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your
  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition
  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your
  guest.
  
  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option
  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if
  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it
  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it
  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest
  and beginning provisioning.

#### SSH

**Optional:**

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `ssh_host` (string) - The address to SSH to. This usually is automatically configured by the
  builder.

- `ssh_port` (int) - The port to connect to SSH. This defaults to `22`.

- `ssh_username` (string) - The username to connect to SSH with. Required if using SSH.

- `ssh_password` (string) - A plaintext password to use to authenticate with SSH.

- `ssh_ciphers` ([]string) - This overrides the value of ciphers supported by default by Golang.
  The default value is [
    "aes128-gcm@openssh.com",
    "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com",
    "aes128-ctr", "aes192-ctr", "aes256-ctr",
  ]
  
  Valid options for ciphers include:
  "aes128-ctr", "aes192-ctr", "aes256-ctr", "aes128-gcm@openssh.com",
  "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com",
  "arcfour256", "arcfour128", "arcfour", "aes128-cbc", "3des-cbc",

- `ssh_clear_authorized_keys` (bool) - If true, Packer will attempt to remove its temporary key from
  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This is a
  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private
  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true
  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to "false";
  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.

- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) algorithms
  supported by default by Golang. Acceptable values include:
  "curve25519-sha256@libssh.org", "ecdh-sha2-nistp256",
  "ecdh-sha2-nistp384", "ecdh-sha2-nistp521",
  "diffie-hellman-group14-sha1", and "diffie-hellman-group1-sha1".

- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.
  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the
  home directory of current user.

- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults
  to `false`.

- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to
  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.
  Example value: `10m`.
  This defaults to `5m`, unless `ssh_handshake_attempts` is set.

- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.

- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect.
  This defaults to `10`, unless a `ssh_timeout` is set.

- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.

- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host. Defaults to `22`.

- `ssh_bastion_agent_auth` (bool) - If `true`, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate with the
  bastion host. Defaults to `false`.

- `ssh_bastion_username` (string) - The username to connect to the bastion host.

- `ssh_bastion_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate with the bastion host.

- `ssh_bastion_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with the
  bastion host. The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the
  home directory of current user.

- `ssh_bastion_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with bastion host.
  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the
  home directory of current user.

- `ssh_file_transfer_method` (string) - `scp` or `sftp` - How to transfer files, Secure copy (default) or SSH
  File Transfer Protocol.
  
  **NOTE**: Guests using Windows with Win32-OpenSSH v9.1.0.0p1-Beta, scp
  (the default protocol for copying data) returns a a non-zero error code since the MOTW
  cannot be set, which cause any file transfer to fail. As a workaround you can override the transfer protocol
  with SFTP instead `ssh_file_transfer_method = "sftp"`.

- `ssh_proxy_host` (string) - A SOCKS proxy host to use for SSH connection

- `ssh_proxy_port` (int) - A port of the SOCKS proxy. Defaults to `1080`.

- `ssh_proxy_username` (string) - The optional username to authenticate with the proxy server.

- `ssh_proxy_password` (string) - The optional password to use to authenticate with the proxy server.

- `ssh_keep_alive_interval` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - How often to send "keep alive" messages to the server. Set to a negative
  value (`-1s`) to disable. Example value: `10s`. Defaults to `5s`.

- `ssh_read_write_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The amount of time to wait for a remote command to end. This might be
  useful if, for example, packer hangs on a connection after a reboot.
  Example: `5m`. Disabled by default.

- `ssh_remote_tunnels` ([]string) - 

- `ssh_local_tunnels` ([]string) - 

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; -->


<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `temporary_key_pair_type` (string) - `dsa` | `ecdsa` | `ed25519` | `rsa` ( the default )
  
  Specifies the type of key to create. The possible values are 'dsa',
  'ecdsa', 'ed25519', or 'rsa'.
  
  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure, please
  consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.

- `temporary_key_pair_bits` (int) - Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA keys, the
  minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 4096 bits. Generally, 3072
  bits is considered sufficient. DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as
  specified by FIPS 186-2. For ECDSA keys, bits determines the key length
  by selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521
  bits. Attempting to use bit lengths other than these three values for
  ECDSA keys will fail. Ed25519 keys have a fixed length and bits will be
  ignored.
  
  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure as specified
  by FIPS 186-5, please consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; -->


- `ssh_keypair_name` (string) - If specified, this is the key that will be used for SSH with the
  machine. The key must match a key pair name loaded up into the remote.
  By default, this is blank, and Packer will generate a temporary keypair
  unless [`ssh_password`](#ssh_password) is used.
  [`ssh_private_key_file`](#ssh_private_key_file) or
  [`ssh_agent_auth`](#ssh_agent_auth) must be specified when
  [`ssh_keypair_name`](#ssh_keypair_name) is utilized.


- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.
  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory
  of current user.


- `ssh_agent_auth` (bool) - If true, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate connections to
  the source instance. No temporary keypair will be created, and the
  values of [`ssh_password`](#ssh_password) and
  [`ssh_private_key_file`](#ssh_private_key_file) will be ignored. The
  environment variable `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` must be set for this option to work
  properly.


#### Windows Remote Management (WinRM)

**Optional:**

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `winrm_username` (string) - The username to use to connect to WinRM.

- `winrm_password` (string) - The password to use to connect to WinRM.

- `winrm_host` (string) - The address for WinRM to connect to.
  
  NOTE: If using an Amazon EBS builder, you can specify the interface
  WinRM connects to via
  [`ssh_interface`](/packer/integrations/morpheus/amazon/latest/components/builder/ebs#ssh_interface)

- `winrm_no_proxy` (bool) - Setting this to `true` adds the remote
  `host:port` to the `NO_PROXY` environment variable. This has the effect of
  bypassing any configured proxies when connecting to the remote host.
  Default to `false`.

- `winrm_port` (int) - The WinRM port to connect to. This defaults to `5985` for plain
  unencrypted connection and `5986` for SSL when `winrm_use_ssl` is set to
  true.

- `winrm_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The amount of time to wait for WinRM to become available. This defaults
  to `30m` since setting up a Windows machine generally takes a long time.

- `winrm_use_ssl` (bool) - If `true`, use HTTPS for WinRM.

- `winrm_insecure` (bool) - If `true`, do not check server certificate chain and host name.

- `winrm_use_ntlm` (bool) - If `true`, NTLMv2 authentication (with session security) will be used
  for WinRM, rather than default (basic authentication), removing the
  requirement for basic authentication to be enabled within the target
  guest. Further reading for remote connection authentication can be found
  [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384295(v=vs.85).aspx).
